# Doubly-Linked-List

This is a generic doubly link list created for maximum flexibility of use. Lambdas are passed as a parameter to search and insert functions so that the user can use classes and other complex data types in the linked list and customize the comparison expression to be evaluated. This list also performs automatic sorting (based on the lambda passed by the user of the list). An example using this list can be found in my Data Structures repo under the Ch3AirlineTickets project directory.
